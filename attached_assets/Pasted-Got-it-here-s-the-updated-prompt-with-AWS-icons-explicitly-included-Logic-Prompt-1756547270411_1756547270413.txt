Got it âœ… â€” hereâ€™s the **updated prompt** with AWS icons explicitly included:

# ðŸŽ¨ Logic Prompt: Node Styling like n8n + Dark Mode + AWS Icons

## ðŸ”¹ Node Styling (like n8n UI)

1. Each **resource node** should look visually like **n8n workflow nodes**:

   * Rounded rectangle with soft shadows.
   * **AWS Service Icon (SVG)** on the left, taken from the official [AWS Architecture Icons](https://aws.amazon.com/architecture/icons/).
   * Node title in bold (e.g., `EC2 Instance`, `S3 Bucket`).
   * Subtext showing details (e.g., `Instance Type: t2.micro`).
   * Color-coding by category:

     * Compute (EC2, Lambda) â†’ Blue
     * Storage (S3, EBS) â†’ Orange
     * Networking (VPC, Subnet, SG) â†’ Green
     * IAM & Security â†’ Purple
   * Hover effect â†’ slight glow border.
   * When selected â†’ highlight border in primary theme color.

2. Nodes must support **drag & drop** creation from the left sidebar (like n8n palette).

3. Nodes are connected with **curved edges** (smooth links) just like n8n workflows.

## ðŸ”¹ Dark Mode in Settings

1. Add a **Settings page** with toggle for **Dark Mode**.
2. When Dark Mode is enabled:

   * Background â†’ Dark grey (#1e1e1e).
   * Nodes â†’ Dark surfaces (#2c2c2c) with light text.
   * Grid lines â†’ subtle (#444).
   * Edges â†’ lighter shade for contrast.
   * AWS icons should **remain colored** (not inverted) for recognition.
3. When Light Mode is enabled:

   * Background â†’ White.
   * Nodes â†’ Light cards (#f5f5f5).
   * Grid lines â†’ subtle grey (#ddd).
4. Preference must be saved in **local storage** so the theme persists across reloads.

## ðŸ”¹ AWS Icons Integration

1. Use the **official AWS Architecture Icons (SVG)** for each service node.
2. Icons should be stored in `/assets/icons/aws/` or fetched via a CDN.
3. Each resource type maps to its AWS icon, for example:

   ```json
   {
     "aws_instance": "icons/aws/ec2.svg",
     "aws_s3_bucket": "icons/aws/s3.svg",
     "aws_vpc": "icons/aws/vpc.svg",
     "aws_subnet": "icons/aws/subnet.svg",
     "aws_iam_role": "icons/aws/iam.svg"
   }
   ```
4. The UI should automatically assign the correct icon when a node is created.
5. If no AWS icon is found, fall back to a **default Lucide icon**.

âš¡ This ensures the UI looks like **n8n**, supports **dark mode**, and uses **official AWS icons** for a professional cloud infrastructure designer.

Do you want me to also extend the prompt so **VPC/Subnet act as containers** (where EC2, RDS, etc. nodes can be dropped inside) with AWS icons still intact?
